                    <span>Work.</span>
                    I recently graduated from Manhattan college in 2022 and am currently pursuing a career as a software developer/engineer, 
                    preferably for the back-end. While I am looking for a job, I’m also continuously improving my skills by solving problems on 
                    LeetCode, and by pursuing professional IT certifications online. I’m also working on a personal project of mine which will eventually 
                    be put on this website. I’m well versed with many different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, etc. 
                    It is my hope that I can eventually be a master in one of these languages and work at a professional, high level with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When coding, my goal is to implement safe, secure, and efficient code. What most attracted me to programming at first, was the problem 
                    solving aspect of it. As I gained more experience in programming, I also learned to love the creation process for developing software 
                    from beginning to end. It is now my hope that I will gain professional work experience in the IT industry and further develop my 
                    knowledge in this field.
                </p>

            <div class="introDescription">
                <p>
                    <span>Fun.</span>
                    For enjoyment, I love playing chess which I’ve casually played on and off since I was a kid. I often play on Chess.com and can be 
                    added on <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/galivar" target="_blank">Galivar</a>, if you would like to verse me. I also enjoy 
                    working out and training in kickboxing. I always found kickboxing and Muay Thai interesting since it takes impressive athletic prowess 
                    to actually do. When I was younger, I also used to play soccer quite a lot, so it made up a huge part of my childhood. My favorite 
                    player of all time would have to be Messi which I feel that most people would agree with me on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technology also plays a huge role in what I love doing since it’s challenging, rewarding, and fun all at the same time. Though it 
                    is such a huge field that is ever evolving, I find this especially fun since it is a lifelong endeavor of constant learning and 
                    improving. I keep busy and I get things done. Check out my <a href="Writings/Resume - Ari Zaravelis.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> to learn more about 
                    what I do.
